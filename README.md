# What Is QuickAlpine
QuickAlpine is a Quick installer for the [reccomended version of alpine linux for kindle](https://github.com/schuhumi/alpine_kindle)
But QuickAlpine is more than an installer, it uninstalls and launches alpine too.
It works through the power of sh scripts and the kindle hotfix feature sh_integration which allows scripts to be on the home screen


# Prerequisites
A jailbroken kindle
Access to the kindle documents folder
A valid internet connection (only for the install and uninstall scripts)

# Setup
Download the install_alpine.sh from the latest release
copy it to the kindle's documents folder, `/documents` for usb or `/mnt/us/documents` with ssh
# Usage
Use the install booklet in the library do note it overwrites your alpine install if one is present. The proccess may take a while but eventually you will return to the home screen
Launch Using the alpine linux booklet (no label just alpine linux)
